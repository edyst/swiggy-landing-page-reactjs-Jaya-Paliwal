                            the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily
                            to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a
                            wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                            to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing
                            the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

                <p class="pp">The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process
                    of getting
                    out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
                    themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July
                    and December.

                    $2 billion in revenue and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global
                    phenomenon it was in 2016, the game remains incredibly popular.</p>

                                knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed
                                in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger
                                evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped
                                into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers
                                should be able to answer.</li>

                            <li> Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off
                                with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the
                                stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any
                                Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective
                                Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is
